## Garaio.CompositeC1Packages.GoogleAnalytics

### What’s this package for?
This package offers you the ability to link Google Analytics with your C1 webpage.

### When could I be interested in using this package?
I’d like to track the traffic on my Composite C1 webpage with the Google Analytics or the Google Universal Analytics toolset.

### How can I use it?
After the package successfully has been installed, you can save your Google Account Id within your C1 console.
If you decide to add the Google Analytics script block to a content page, you could easily do this by adding the **render script block** or **render universal script block** function to your content page.
The previously configured Google Account Id will be automatically added to your page.

### Where can I find further information?
Our Composite C1 Add-ons are hosted @ Github: https://github.com/garaio
We appreciate your comments and ideas for improvements.

Thank you!
